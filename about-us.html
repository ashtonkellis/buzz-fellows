          <p>Meet Ashton!</p>
          <p>My name is Ashtons, and I am an aspiring full-stack JavaScript developer with a background in Health Physics. I have a deep passion for hobbies that don't require having to go outside, including: coding, board games, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am racked with indecision as to whether to take 401 Python or 401 JavaScript, and this quiz helped me a lot! I hope it will help you too.</p>

          <p>Meet Ben!</p>
          <p>Hi! I am Ben, and I am an aspiring software developer with prior experience in Python, Java, C#, and SQL Server. I am currently planning on taking the JavaScript 401 course at Code Fellows. Fun Fact: I have a serious case of Pac-Man fever, and you can often fine me playing it in my free time.</p>

          <p>Meet Jenny!</p>
          <p>Hi there! My name is Jenny and I am currently working towards becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer. I have a background in non-profit/social work, and I hope to be able to create dynamic and beautiful web pages for my clients, as well as volunteer my skills for local non-profits. I, like my peers, was unsure of what 401 class to take, and this quiz pointed me in the righ direction! Give it a shot if you are still unsure which path to take.</p>

          <p>Meet Mario!</p>
          <p>Hi, my name is Mario Nishio. I'm a full-stack Javascript developer with a diverse background involving research and education. I, also, was unsure about my 401 class decision, so I wanted to make an app that gives me that extra nudge in my decision making.</p>
